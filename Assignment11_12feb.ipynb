    "#### In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It represents an error or an exceptional condition that the program encounters while running. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing its normal sequence and jumps to a specific block of code called an exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Exceptions:\n",
    "#### i) Occur during runtime: Exceptions are detected and raised during the execution of the program when an exceptional condition is encountered.\n",
    "#### ii) Caused by runtime issues: Exceptions are typically caused by factors such as invalid data, resource unavailability, or other runtime errors.\n",
    "#### iii) Handled using try-except blocks: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. The code within the try block is executed, and if an exception occurs, the corresponding except block is executed to handle the exception.\n",
    "#### Examples: Some common exceptions in Python include TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, ZeroDivisionError, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i) Detected during parsing: Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase before the code is executed.\n",
    "#### ii) Caused by code structure issues: Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules and structure of the Python language's syntax. This can include missing colons, mismatched parentheses, incorrect indentation, or using undefined variables.\n",
    "#### iii) Prevent the program from running: Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all because they violate the basic rules of the language's syntax. The interpreter cannot interpret and execute the code with syntax errors until they are fixed.\n",
    "#### Examples: Examples of syntax errors include missing colons in a function definition, using an invalid operator, or mismatched parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, exceptions occur during runtime and are caused by exceptional conditions encountered during program execution. They can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. On the other hand, syntax errors are detected during the parsing phase before execution and prevent the program from running until they are fixed. They occur due to violations of the language syntax rules."
